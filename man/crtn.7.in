.SH NAME
crtn \- API of CoRouTiNe service

.SH DESCRIPTION

The
.B CRTN
API is a set of services to manage concurrent execution flows in a program. They are named coroutines.
A coroutine can be suspended or resumed under the control of the user. The underlying operating system
have no idea of their existence.

.PP
The service is based on GLIBC's services to save/restore the execution contexts of the coroutines.

.PP
The API is provided through a shared library named
.BR libcrtn.so .
The interface file is <crtn.h>.

.PP
A coroutine is created with
.BR crtn_spawn (3).
The latter returns a unique coroutine identifier (cid).

.PP
Two types of coroutines are provided: stackless and stackful.

.PP
The stackless coroutines are typically used in environment where memory space is a constraint. But they suffer some limitations: the local variables content are no longer valid when there are resumed. The local variables must be reinitialized each time a coroutine is resumed. Moreover, it is not advised to suspend the execution of a stackless coroutine from a sub-function has the stack frames may be clobbered when the coroutine is resumed.

.PP
The stackful coroutines have their own stack. So, there are no restrictions concerning the data stored in the stack. They are private to the coroutine.
It is also possible to set the stack size to a value different than the default one.

.PP
Two scheduling types are provided: stepper and standalone.

.PP
A stepper coroutine is by default suspended. Another coroutine must call
.BR crtn_wait (3)
to resume it. The coroutine suspends itself upon a call to
.BR crtn_yield (3).

.PP
A standalone coroutine is by default always runnable. It suspends its execution upon a call to
.BR crtn_yield (3).
But it stays runnable and may be resumed at any moment when a call
to
.BR crtn_yield (3)
is done by any other coroutine. Internally, the scheduling is managed in a FIFO manner to make sure that a standalone corouting which relinquishes the CPU does not get it right away (unless it is the only runnable coroutine at the moment).

.PP
A coroutine terminates when it reaches the end of its entry point, when it calls
.BR crtn_exit (3)
or when another coroutine calls
.BR crtn_cancel (3)
to finish it.

.PP
A terminated coroutine stays in a zombie state until another coroutine calls
.BR crtn_join (3)
to get its termination status and to implicitly free the corresponding internal data structures.
The latter is an integer with a user defined signification.

.PP
Inter-coroutine communication/synchronization are provided: the mailboxes
.BR "(" crtn_mbx "(3))"
and semaphores
.BR "(" crtn_sem "(3))."
Those services are optional. They are set at package configuration time.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

Several environment variables are interpreted at library's initialization time:

.IP CRTN_MAX
Maximum number of coroutines (@CFG_CRTN_MAX@ by default).

.IP CRTN_MBX_MAX
Maximum number of semaphores (@CFG_CRTN_MBX_MAX@ by default).

.IP CRTN_SEM_MAX
Maximum number of semaphores (@CFG_CRTN_SEM_MAX@ by default).

.IP CRTN_STACK_SIZE
Size in bytes of the stack of stackless/stackful coroutines (@CFG_CRTN_STACK_SIZE@ by default).
