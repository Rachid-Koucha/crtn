## <a name="Introduction"></a>1 Introduction

CoRouTiNe (CRTN) is a shared library providing an API which proposes coroutines in C language programs. This is a set of services to manage concurrent execution flows. A coroutine can be suspended or resumed under the control of the user. The underlying operating system have no idea of their existence.

CRTN is distributed under the GNU LGPL license.

The current document concerns the @VERSION@ version of the CRTN package.

## <a name="Build_suite"></a>3 Build suite

CRTN is built with CMAKE.


## <a name="Download"></a>4 Download

The source code is available on github. Use the following command to download it:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Rachid-Koucha/crtn.git
```

## <a name="cmake"></a>5 cmake


### <a name="crtn_install_sh_scritpt"></a>5.1 crtn_install.sh script


This shell script is a swiss army knife to make several things. It implicitly uses `cmake`. Display its help:

```
$ ./crtn_install.sh -h

Usage:

  crtn_install.sh [-b browser] [-c] [-T|-C] [-d install_dir] [-o MBX|SEM]
                  [-B] [-I] [-U] [-A] [-P RPM|DEB|TGZ|STGZ] [-h]

    -b    : Browser's pathname to display the test coverage HTML results
    -c    : Cleanup built objects
    -C    : Launch the test coverage measurement
    -T    : Launch the regression tests
    -d    : Installation directory (default: @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@)
    -P (*): Generate DEB/RPM/TGZ/STGZ packages
    -B    : Build the software
    -I (*): Install the software
    -U (*): Uninstall the software
    -A    : Generate an archive of the software (sources)
    -o    : Add MBX|SEM service
    -h    : this help

   (*) Super user rights required
```

Note that some options require super user privileges to run. Use `sudo` for example.


### <a name="Build_installation_cleanup"></a>5.2 Build, installation, cleanup


* To build the library:

`$ ./crtn_install.sh -B`

* If mailbox and/or semaphores are required, add the corresponding option on the command line:

`$ ./crtn_install.sh -B -o mbx -o sem`

* For a complete installation in the default @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@ subtree (super user rights required):

`$ sudo ./crtn_install.sh -I`

* To uninstall the software (super user rights required):

`$ sudo ./crtn_install.sh -U`

* To cleanup every generated files to go back to original source tree:

`$ ./crtn_install.sh -c`


### <a name="Tests"></a>5.3 Tests

The regression tests are based on CHECK library. The latter must be installed
prior to launch the tests.

To trigger the regression tests for the whole software:

$ ./crtn_install.sh -T
[...]
100%: Checks: 31, Failures: 0, Errors: 0


### <a name="Tests_coverage_measurement"></a>5.4 Tests coverage measurement

The test coverage measurement requires the `gcov/lcov` packages.

To trigger test coverage measurement for CRTN (with a display of the result in firefox):

`$ ./crtn_install.sh -C -b firefox`


### <a name="Packaging"></a>5.5 Packaging

To make a tar gzip source package, use the `-A` option of `crtn_install.sh`:

`$ ./crtn_install.sh -A`

This makes a TGZ file of the complete source tree: crtn_src-@VERSION@.tgz


It is also possible to generate Debian (DEB), Red-Hat Package Manager (RPM), Tar GZipped (TGZ) and Self Extracting Tar GZipped (STGZ) binary packages.

To build the packages TGZ, DEB, RPM... (super user rights required):

`$ sudo ./crtn_install.sh -c -P tgz -P rpm -P deb -P stgz`

This makes the following binary packages:
* @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_@VERSION@_amd64.deb (DEB)
* @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@-@VERSION@-1.x86_64.rpm (RPM)
* @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@-@VERSION@-Linux-crtn.tar.gz (TGZ)
* @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@-@VERSION@-Linux-crtn.sh (STGZ)
